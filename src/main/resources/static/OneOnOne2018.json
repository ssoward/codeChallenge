He strikes an impressive balance of being a mentor, a leader, a business analyst and a developer. He’s a true senior engineer but a talented leader as well. \n\nAmbitions: I suspect he’d like to be an SM at one point.  \n\nFYI: You should plan on meeting with Steve monthly, if not more, to get an update on his team members and to see how you can support him. He makes Kevin’s job way easier and mine as well. If you get a chance to attend a conference with Steve, do it. He’s great company and someone I look up to tremendously.

They're next to useless, Jason moreso than Jeff. Reporting isn't really happening.  \n\nDrew is being pulled off so much it has slowed down Calendar.  \n\nVictories \n\nLikes to work on visually interesting things. Likes new stuff. Likes the challenge of maps. Likes new technologies. Has good hardware, likes to do conferences, always wants to advance – wants to be a level 6. Talk to Kevin about him being a level 6.  \n\nWants to do UtahJS – him and Matt. Also wants to do Rich Web in Florida – him and Matt. Looking for 3 others that want to go because if 4 sign up the 5th is free. Rich Web Early Bird is before September.  \n\nTraining/Sharpening the Saw \n\nIn depth training cross-portfolio would be best. Good to show off what others are doing and see if people are interested. Header and Footer, for example, would be great to learn about properly.  \n\n \n\nWorkshop before SORT would be an interesting idea. As well as 20% time like Google.  \n\n \n\nAugust 16, 2017 \n\nDoing well. Wants to know what the next project will be after Pros Maps. Worried about being busy for Q4? Can we closeout LDS Maps 3 Classic – is there budget for that? Jason Allsop continues to be unmotivated and not any help really. Jeff Nelson is similar, but better than Jason. No trust exists between the developers and QA, so the devs figure they have to do their own QA. \n\nWorked on ATI Goals. \n\nSeptember 14, 2017 \n\nFollow-up on Jason and Jeff \n\nFollow-up on Level 6 promotion \n\nFollow-up on goals \n\nJonathan would like PluralSight Access.  \n\nJonathan said that things are going well. Jason and Jeff are doing better but Jeff more than Jason.  \n\nOctober 13, 2017 \n\nJeff has been doing well and is even working on some automation and will be showing that. Jason is getting some reports but they’re not very specific or helpful. Dev to QA ratio is still way off.  \n\nFor his PSI, he’s going to try building an indoor map using Kotlin, Gradle and other new technologies. On the front end there will be translating them into SVGs and put them in a lat/long map and do directions from one place to another. I’m loving the idea of this whole thing. \n\nLast year’s raise was 2.7 and was pretty disappointing. On the flow graph, he’s in the boredom range for the calendar stuff but in the flow for the proselyting maps. \n\nWhat are we doing Q1 next year? UMLU sucked up all the funding last year. What will happen if Drew leaves and the team is 2QA to 2Devs. \n\nNovember 9, 2017 \n\nThings are going well – mostly working on maps and in the flow. \n\nJason – Hardly reports any bugs and really needs to do more, mostly passing along bugs found by PMs, assistant PMs, missionaries, etc. Doing better at not playing tech support. Jonathan will provide some specific Jira details for me to meet with Jason on. \n\nWould love to have Troy back on the team and will talk with Kevin about future team structure and projects going into 2018. He's concerned about team structure if we lose Drew to the mobile team and the imbalance of QA to Devs, which is already too QA-heavy.  \n\nPSI is going well, had to miss the last one but will make it up this next week.  \n\nJonathan is still feeling kind of stuck with his position – can't move to level 6, is lower than he wants to be on the pay scale and feels like he's kind of gotten the shaft given all of the effort he's put into the team and the work he does. Took last year's standard pay bump as slap in the face.  \n\nWe talked about pay vs responsibility, possible future jobs in management and other such things. He'd like to keep developing for at least the next five years and might be interested in project or product management after that but not now. He understands about the level 6 and if we can keep him challenged and in a leadership role then he'd be ok with that too. He's not feeling all that challenged in general right now. \n\nI think we might want to look at an inline pay adjustment with Jonathan. He's been here since college and that's hurt him more than helped him financially. \n\n \n\nDecember 14, 2017 \n\nJason: Still doing better than he was. I've noticed that his stand up reports have been pretty soft – usually only talks about what he's doing that day, not if he accomplished the tasks of the day before. Also his reports are vague in general. He'll say one thing he's working on and that's it. No card numbers, no list of items just \"Working on x today\".  \n\nJeff: Has been out for half of the month but is doing better in general. Especially for a level 1. \n\nMatt: Doing great, is concerned about the team breaking up but is doing great.  \n\n2018 Goals – Start thinking about those now \n\nNils' follow-ups:  \n\nTalk with Kevin about projects, billing and 2018 for Jonathan and their team. Mobile team lead? Other options? \n\nTalk with HR about getting an inline adjustment for Jonathan. He's been here 11.5 years, he's been a level 5 for 3 years, he's making $114k, he's a key contributor – a \"can't lose this guy\" lead for many years with his maps knowledge. What can we do? Things to consider: before or after AMI? Don't lump AMI and this to one thing. Is the PB still having to approve everything? \n\nI sent emails to both Kevin and HR on December 14th. \n\n \n\nJanuary 11, 2018 \n\nDiscuss:  \n\nHow's the fam/life? \n\n2018 Plans (talked with Kevin) \n\nIn-line adjustment \n\n2018 ATI Goals by end of month (engineer and team lead) \n\nNo 2017 ATI reviews yet \n\nFlow \n\nPSI \n\nHow are Jeff and Drew doing? \n\nSpiritual Reliance \n\nFebruary 8, 2018 \n\nJonathan is doing well. He's concerned about what work he's going to be doing one week from now – there's not much going on. He has some maintenance he can work on if need be. I talked to Kevin afterward and Kevin just had a maps project fall through but then got another one that they want to move on right away so that's likely what Jonathan and Jeff will work on. I also told Jonathan that we went to bat for him as much as possible on the AMI and that it might be all we can do (as opposed to doing an in-line-adjustment as well) and he was grateful for anything we could do.  \n\nAll in all things are going ok – no worries other than keeping busy with work and wanting to know what's coming in 2018 as far as work and team. We just don't have those answers yet. \n\n \n\nMarch 14, 2018 \n\nI presented Jonathan's raise to him in our AMI conversation and he did really well. He got one of the biggest raises in the portfolio and it worked out to close to 6,000 additional/year. We did this because there were talks of presenting him as a candidate for an inline adjustment (ILA) but Ron counseled us to use the AMI to take care of everyone instead. We couldn't get Jonathan quite to where he wanted and he mentioned that when I presented his raise. He'd like to be more in the 125k range. I talked to Dustin about this and he said it's unlikely that this would work but we can pursue an ILA and see how it goes to make up the difference. \n\nI told Jonathan about this and he really wants to go for it. I prepped him for whatever comes since it's unlikely that this will go through. He's ok with that but wants to try. I have scheduled a meeting with Kevin to review this. I will then schedule with Ron. \n\nOtherwise things are going well. He's keeping busy with multiple small projects and has the directory/map project coming up soon. He's already involved with it but development hasn't started yet. I also told him I'd like to help with his indoor maps PSI project.  \n\n \n\nApril 12, 2018 \n\nI found out from HR that Jonathan's ILA didn't go through. I'm not sure at what point it failed exactly but we're having a hard time getting anything to go through right now so the raise he got was quite fortunate. That'll likely be all we see this year for him and we'll see how next year goes. All said and done, he still received one of the biggest raises in the portfolio. \n\nFollow up: \n\nPSI \n\nJeff, Drew \n\nATI  \n\nFlow – He's definitely on the bored side \n\n \n\nMay 14, 2018 \n\nTrying to get Jeff out of Calendar. Drew too. Jeff has been writing some load tests and other service/end point tests but hasn't committed yet. Needs to have a test plan for Directory (Ward Directory and Map) and then make sure to communicate with the devs what testing they should be doing. \n\nLDS Tools / UMLU – too many cooks in the kitchen and Kevin needs to be more of decision maker or appoint someone to do so. Seems cyclical and has been going on for months. Drew has been in the same boat. Stuck because of the Enterprise services team because of their database access. Lots of things in the air but no great decisions yet. \n\nUMLU was supposed to do some work on Auth and finish some takeaways – did this ever happen? It would be appreciated for Local Unit Apps.  \n\n \n\nJuly 12, 2018 \n\nFollowed up with Kevin on the decision making – is that still an issue? Do you have more details on what you'd like to see changed? \n\nTroy was supposed to finish the auth stuff up but he got moved onto the blacklist stuff instead. \n\nThere have been two meetings with multiple senior developers, 2 hours each, talking in circles about LDS Tools Sync. Nobody was in charge and decisions weren't really made and there needed to be a leader. Same thing happened with membership authentication models. There wasn't an agenda, no action items, no takeaways. \n\nAny follow up on Troy's work on auth? \n\nHasn't been doing PSI but has been learning tons of new things day to day. He had put the internal map project on hold to work on a Cartography course online but by the time he got back from vacation it had been closed so he's hoping to find another or to continue on the internal map project. \n\nAmassing technical debt on the old projects, like legacy maps services – it's getting worse and worse. Needs to be prioritized. Wants it on Stack 4, oAuth, SQL Server, etc – is that a possibility? \n\nFor Josh Kitterman – how do we get that list together of old projects that need updating? \n\nWhat's the plan with Jonathan and the mobile team and combining. Is he ScrumMaster for both? \n\nArcGIS Portal stuff is never prioritized either and there are other factions doing their own non-enterprise portals and we need an enterprise version put together. \n\nThere are tons of projects that he could do (see above) but he doesn't have anybody but Drew to work with. Huge backlog, limited personnel and no prioritization for those tasks. \n\n \n\nAugust 9, 2018 \n\nRon: Why the two portfolios? \nTwo separate TLC meetings – maybe combine once in a while instead of every time. \n\nAs a follow up on these, Ron said we’re doing the combined portfolios because we need less portfolios otherwise we end up with 40 of them. Technically we could break up our interests/goals much further than CSP and MSR but we combine where it makes sense. There are no immediate plans to make changes to the portfolio, though things could change at any time, as is the nature of any company. \n\nAs for TLC meetings being separated out, we have been discussing this. Dave and I will meet with the architects to further discuss but we understand the challenge and will see if we can come up with a way to make sure nobody’s time is wasted.

Kris has lead the LCR team for years and has done an excellent job keeping the new features rolling out and the bugs away. He enjoys working with his great teammates and was very patient when he had some not so great teammates. He’s the principal force behind LCR. \n\nAmbitions: Wants to be in management at some point but not sure if he’s ready for that yet. He loves coding and would like to do more when the time is right. He did not apply for the SEM position. \n\nFYI: Kris can be a bit abrasive from time to time when he gets frustrated. He’s not at all unkind or rude but he can be perceived as such when he gets passionate about a topic or frustrated with someone’s direction. It’s really not an issue 99.9% of the time and he does really well in nearly all situations.

Pearson – Developer (full stack) - LCR \n\nStrengths: Leadership, commitment to a deadline, teachability, hunger to know more, kindness and intrinsic motivation. Kris has lead the LCR team for years and has done an excellent job keeping the new features rolling out and the bugs away. He enjoys working with his great teammates and was very patient when he had some not so great teammates. He’s the principal force behind LCR. \n\nAmbitions: Wants to be in management at some point but not sure if he’s ready for that yet. He loves coding and would like to do more when the time is right. He did not apply for the SEM position. \n\nFYI: Kris can be a bit abrasive from time to time when he gets frustrated. He’s not at all unkind or rude but he can be perceived as such when he gets passionate about a topic or frustrated with someone’s direction. It’s really not an issue 99.9% of the time and he does really well in nearly all situations.

Likes the challenge of maps. Likes new technologies. Has good hardware, likes to do conferences, always wants to advance – wants to be a level 6. Talk to Kevin about him being a level 6.  \n\nWants to do UtahJS – him and Matt. Also wants to do Rich Web in Florida – him and Matt. Looking for 3 others that want to go because if 4 sign up the 5th is free. Rich Web Early Bird is before September.  \n\nTraining/Sharpening the Saw \n\nIn depth training cross-portfolio would be best. Good to show off what others are doing and see if people are interested. Header and Footer, for example, would be great to learn about properly.  \n\n \n\nWorkshop before SORT would be an interesting idea. As well as 20% time like Google.  \n\n \n\nAugust 16, 2017 \n\nDoing well. Wants to know what the next project will be after Pros Maps. Worried about being busy for Q4? Can we closeout LDS Maps 3 Classic – is there budget for that? Jason Allsop continues to be unmotivated and not any help really. Jeff Nelson is similar, but better than Jason. No trust exists between the developers and QA, so the devs figure they have to do their own QA. \n\nWorked on ATI Goals. \n\nSeptember 14, 2017 \n\nFollow-up on Jason and Jeff \n\nFollow-up on Level 6 promotion \n\nFollow-up on goals \n\nJonathan would like PluralSight Access.  \n\nJonathan said that things are going well. Jason and Jeff are doing better but Jeff more than Jason.  \n\nOctober 13, 2017 \n\nJeff has been doing well and is even working on some automation and will be showing that. Jason is getting some reports but they’re not very specific or helpful. Dev to QA ratio is still way off.  \n\nFor his PSI, he’s going to try building an indoor map using Kotlin, Gradle and other new technologies. On the front end there will be translating them into SVGs and put them in a lat/long map and do directions from one place to another. I’m loving the idea of this whole thing. \n\nLast year’s raise was 2.7 and was pretty disappointing. On the flow graph, he’s in the boredom range for the calendar stuff but in the flow for the proselyting maps. \n\nWhat are we doing Q1 next year? UMLU sucked up all the funding last year. What will happen if Drew leaves and the team is 2QA to 2Devs. \n\nNovember 9, 2017 \n\nThings are going well – mostly working on maps and in the flow. \n\nJason – Hardly reports any bugs and really needs to do more, mostly passing along bugs found by PMs, assistant PMs, missionaries, etc. Doing better at not playing tech support. Jonathan will provide some specific Jira details for me to meet with Jason on. \n\nWould love to have Troy back on the team and will talk with Kevin about future team structure and projects going into 2018. He's concerned about team structure if we lose Drew to the mobile team and the imbalance of QA to Devs, which is already too QA-heavy.  \n\nPSI is going well, had to miss the last one but will make it up this next week.  \n\nJonathan is still feeling kind of stuck with his position – can't move to level 6, is lower than he wants to be on the pay scale and feels like he's kind of gotten the shaft given all of the effort he's put into the team and the work he does. Took last year's standard pay bump as slap in the face.  \n\nWe talked about pay vs responsibility, possible future jobs in management and other such things. He'd like to keep developing for at least the next five years and might be interested in project or product management after that but not now. He understands about the level 6 and if we can keep him challenged and in a leadership role then he'd be ok with that too. He's not feeling all that challenged in general right now. \n\nI think we might want to look at an inline pay adjustment with Jonathan. He's been here since college and that's hurt him more than helped him financially. \n\n \n\nDecember 14, 2017 \n\nJason: Still doing better than he was. I've noticed that his stand up reports have been pretty soft – usually only talks about what he's doing that day, not if he accomplished the tasks of the day before. Also his reports are vague in general. He'll say one thing he's working on and that's it. No card numbers, no list of items just \"Working on x today\".  \n\nJeff: Has been out for half of the month but is doing better in general. Especially for a level 1. \n\nMatt: Doing great, is concerned about the team breaking up but is doing great.  \n\n2018 Goals – Start thinking about those now \n\nNils' follow-ups:  \n\nTalk with Kevin about projects, billing and 2018 for Jonathan and their team. Mobile team lead? Other options? \n\nTalk with HR about getting an inline adjustment for Jonathan. He's been here 11.5 years, he's been a level 5 for 3 years, he's making $114k, he's a key contributor – a \"can't lose this guy\" lead for many years with his maps knowledge. What can we do? Things to consider: before or after AMI? Don't lump AMI and this to one thing. Is the PB still having to approve everything? \n\nI sent emails to both Kevin and HR on December 14th. \n\n \n\nJanuary 11, 2018 \n\nDiscuss:  \n\nHow's the fam/life? \n\n2018 Plans (talked with Kevin) \n\nIn-line adjustment \n\n2018 ATI Goals by end of month (engineer and team lead) \n\nNo 2017 ATI reviews yet \n\nFlow \n\nPSI \n\nHow are Jeff and Drew doing? \n\nSpiritual Reliance \n\nFebruary 8, 2018 \n\nJonathan is doing well. He's concerned about what work he's going to be doing one week from now – there's not much going on. He has some maintenance he can work on if need be. I talked to Kevin afterward and Kevin just had a maps project fall through but then got another one that they want to move on right away so that's likely what Jonathan and Jeff will work on. I also told Jonathan that we went to bat for him as much as possible on the AMI and that it might be all we can do (as opposed to doing an in-line-adjustment as well) and he was grateful for anything we could do.  \n\nAll in all things are going ok – no worries other than keeping busy with work and wanting to know what's coming in 2018 as far as work and team. We just don't have those answers yet. \n\n \n\nMarch 14, 2018 \n\nI presented Jonathan's raise to him in our AMI conversation and he did really well. He got one of the biggest raises in the portfolio and it worked out to close to 6,000 additional/year. We did this because there were talks of presenting him as a candidate for an inline adjustment (ILA) but Ron counseled us to use the AMI to take care of everyone instead. We couldn't get Jonathan quite to where he wanted and he mentioned that when I presented his raise. He'd like to be more in the 125k range. I talked to Dustin about this and he said it's unlikely that this would work but we can pursue an ILA and see how it goes to make up the difference. \n\nI told Jonathan about this and he really wants to go for it. I prepped him for whatever comes since it's unlikely that this will go through. He's ok with that but wants to try. I have scheduled a meeting with Kevin to review this. I will then schedule with Ron. \n\nOtherwise things are going well. He's keeping busy with multiple small projects and has the directory/map project coming up soon. He's already involved with it but development hasn't started yet. I also told him I'd like to help with his indoor maps PSI project.  \n\n \n\nApril 12, 2018 \n\nI found out from HR that Jonathan's ILA didn't go through. I'm not sure at what point it failed exactly but we're having a hard time getting anything to go through right now so the raise he got was quite fortunate. That'll likely be all we see this year for him and we'll see how next year goes. All said and done, he still received one of the biggest raises in the portfolio. \n\nFollow up: \n\nPSI \n\nJeff, Drew \n\nATI  \n\nFlow – He's definitely on the bored side \n\n \n\nMay 14, 2018 \n\nTrying to get Jeff out of Calendar. Drew too. Jeff has been writing some load tests and other service/end point tests but hasn't committed yet. Needs to have a test plan for Directory (Ward Directory and Map) and then make sure to communicate with the devs what testing they should be doing. \n\nLDS Tools / UMLU – too many cooks in the kitchen and Kevin needs to be more of decision maker or appoint someone to do so. Seems cyclical and has been going on for months. Drew has been in the same boat. Stuck because of the Enterprise services team because of their database access. Lots of things in the air but no great decisions yet. \n\nUMLU was supposed to do some work on Auth and finish some takeaways – did this ever happen? It would be appreciated for Local Unit Apps.  \n\n \n\nJuly 12, 2018 \n\nFollowed up with Kevin on the decision making – is that still an issue? Do you have more details on what you'd like to see changed? \n\nTroy was supposed to finish the auth stuff up but he got moved onto the blacklist stuff instead. \n\nThere have been two meetings with multiple senior developers, 2 hours each, talking in circles about LDS Tools Sync. Nobody was in charge and decisions weren't really made and there needed to be a leader. Same thing happened with membership authentication models. There wasn't an agenda, no action items, no takeaways. \n\nAny follow up on Troy's work on auth? \n\nHasn't been doing PSI but has been learning tons of new things day to day. He had put the internal map project on hold to work on a Cartography course online but by the time he got back from vacation it had been closed so he's hoping to find another or to continue on the internal map project. \n\nAmassing technical debt on the old projects, like legacy maps services – it's getting worse and worse. Needs to be prioritized. Wants it on Stack 4, oAuth, SQL Server, etc – is that a possibility? \n\nFor Josh Kitterman – how do we get that list together of old projects that need updating? \n\nWhat's the plan with Jonathan and the mobile team and combining. Is he ScrumMaster for both? \n\nArcGIS Portal stuff is never prioritized either and there are other factions doing their own non-enterprise portals and we need an enterprise version put together. \n\nThere are tons of projects that he could do (see above) but he doesn't have anybody but Drew to work with. Huge backlog, limited personnel and no prioritization for those tasks. \n\n \n\nAugust 9, 2018 \n\nRon: Why the two portfolios? \nTwo separate TLC meetings – maybe combine once in a while instead of every time. \n\nAs a follow up on these, Ron said we’re doing the combined portfolios because we need less portfolios otherwise we end up with 40 of them. Technically we could break up our interests/goals much further than CSP and MSR but we combine where it makes sense. There are no immediate plans to make changes to the portfolio, though things could change at any time, as is the nature of any company. \n\nAs for TLC meetings being separated out, we have been discussing this. Dave and I will meet with the architects to further discuss but we understand the challenge and will see if we can come up with a way to make sure nobody’s time is wasted.
